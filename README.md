**Notes on Servos**

Servos used for this project are the Hitec HS-322HD. Other servos could be used, but the servo horn design may not fit. Feel free to submit horn designs that fit other servos!

Inspiration for the horns taken from the [InMoov robot hand](http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:17773/#instructions), whose design process can be found [here](http://funlab.fr/funwiki/doku.php?id=projets:construction_du_robot_inmouv) (the link is in French, but Google Translate does a pretty good job).
